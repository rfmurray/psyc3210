# practice5b.py  Lecture 5b practice problems

# Some problems will require tools from earlier lectures, such as lists and
# loops. This will be the case in workshop problems from now on.

# 1. Define a function power(x, n) that returns x to the power of n.
# Use it to assign the variable y the value of 2 to the power of 8.

# 2. Define a function randu(n) that returns a list with n elements,
# where each element is a random number between 0 and 1.

# 3. Revise your answer to quesiton 2, to define a function randu(n, u, v)
# that returns a list with n elements, where each element is a random
# number between u and v. Give u a default value of 0, and v a default
# value of 1.

# 3. Create a function bsort(x) that uses the bubblesort algorithm from
# lecture 2b to sort a list x. You can just copy and paste the code from
# lecture 2b into the function.

# practice6b.py  Lecture 6b practice problem

# This problem is a bit harder than the ones I've assigned so far, but
# give it a try. We've covered everything you need to know to solve it,
# but it will involve bringing together things you've learned about
# psychopy and numpy.

# Write a program that uses psychopy to show an endless movie of
# random noise. The program will loop forever (i.e., while True),, and on
# each frame, you will use numpy to create a 256 x 256 array of random
# numbers between -1 and 1, and then draw it to the window just like the
# lecture code drew the picture of Einstein. Do this in an infinite loop.
# Allow the user to press any key to quit the loop and end the program.

# Good luck!

# practice3b.py  Lecture 3b practice problem

# Write a Python script that uses the PsychoPy package to solve the following
# problem. Feel free to adapt code from the lectures for your solution.

# 1. Write a script that tests an observer's ability to centre a small circle
# in larger circle. The large circle appears at a fixed location at the centre
# of the screen. The small circle tracks the position of the mouse cursor.
# When the user clicks the mouse, the trial ends.
# 
# Later in the course we will see how we can then find the difference between
# the positions of the centres of the two circles. You may be able to figure
# this out given what we've covered already, so give that a try too if you'd like.

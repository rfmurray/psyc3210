# Add code below the following comments, to solve the problems.

# 1. Create a list x that contains the numbers 100 to 110.

# 2. Set a variable y equal to the following elements or sublists of x. When
# possible, write your code so that it works for any length of x, e.g., it still
# works if x has 20 elements rather than 11.

# 2a. the first element of x

# 2b. the first five elements of x

# 2c. the last element of x

# 2d. the last five elements of x

# 2e. the first three elements of x and the last three elements of x

# 2f. the first five elements of x, repeated ten times, i.e., the list
#     [ 100, ..., 104 ], repeated ten times

# 2g. the largest element of x, repeated five times

# 2h. the smallest element of x, repeated a number of times equal to
#     the largest element of x

# 3. Change the list x as follows.

# 3a. set the first element to zero

# 3b. set the last three elements to zero

# 3c. delete the fourth and fifth elements of x

# 3d. delete the last element of x

# 3e. append the value 120 to the end of x

# 3f. append the first three elements of x to the end of x

# 3g. sort the elements of x

# 4. Create a tuple z that contains the following elements.

# 4a. the number 50

# 4b. the number 50, repeated three times

# 4c. the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order, repeated five times
